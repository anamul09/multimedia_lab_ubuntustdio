In 1907,Harprasad Shastri unveils 'Charapad' from the library of the Rajdarbar of Nepal.Two other books named 'Dakarkanab' and 'Dohaakos' with Charpas were unearthed from Nepal's princely state.Later on, Acharya Sunit Kumar Chattopadhyay established the undisputed link between Bengali and Bangla with scientific explanations through linguistic analysis.The main poets of Charjapad are Lupa, Kahn Pad, Vusku Pad and Shabarpad.In 1926, Dr. Sunitikumar Chattopadhyay, in his The Origin and Development of the Bengali Language, proved that the compilation was composed in Adi language.
